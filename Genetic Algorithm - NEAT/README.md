# NEAT-Genetic-Algorithm


This is an evolutionary based adaptive neural controller which exhibits some behaviours and similar mechanisms as an adaptive growth process. The system aims to mimic the
behaviour seen in ant colonies by creating stable trail structures within a variable environment. It achieves this with the use of neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) algorithm for the generation of evolving artificial neural networks to mimic an ants brain.
