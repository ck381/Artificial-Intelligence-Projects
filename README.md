The project designs and trains a neural network to be able to classify objects from the CIFAR-10 dataset which contains a total of 60,000 32x32 RGB images from 10 different object classes, achieving an accuracy of 82%.


# <b>NEAT-Genetic-Algorithm</b>


This is an evolutionary based adaptive neural controller which exhibits some behaviours and similar mechanisms as an adaptive growth process. The system aims to mimic the
behaviour seen in ant colonies by creating stable trail structures within a variable environment. It achieves this with the use of neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT) algorithm for the generation of evolving artificial neural networks to mimic an ants brain.

# Naive-Bayes-Classifier

This is an implementation of a simple word list classifier and a naive bayes language model. It includes the training of both and a full evaluation and comparison of the two using appropriate metrics.
